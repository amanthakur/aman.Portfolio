    <h4></h4>
    <p>
The COVID-19 pandemic created a need for a secure and user-friendly system to manage health information and ensure public safety. There was a challenge in providing a reliable way for individuals to verify their health status when entering public spaces, and for businesses to safely manage customer entry without compromising privacy. The problem required a digital solution that could help reduce the spread of the virus while allowing daily life to continue as safely as possible.

    Role & Team</h3>
    <h4></h4>
    
 <p> This project was a personal initiative, where I took on the role of UX/UI Designer. My primary responsibility was to design a comprehensive and intuitive mobile application from the ground up. This involved conducting research, creating user flows, and designing all visual interfaces to ensure a seamless user experience. I operated as a one-person team for this design phase, creating a detailed prototype to demonstrate the full functionality of the proposed solution.</p>

    <h3> <img className='' src={Challenges} alt="Role" />Challenges</h3>
    <h4></h4>
    
 <p> The main challenge was creating a system that handled sensitive personal and health information while building user trust. I had to design a solution that felt secure and transparent, assuring users that their data was protected. Another significant challenge was making the application accessible and understandable for a wide audience, including those who are not tech-savvy. The interface had to be intuitive enough for anyone to use without extensive training.</p>

    <h3> <img className='' src={Approch} alt="Approch" />Approach</h3>
    <h4></h4>
    
    
    
    <p>My design approach was centered on user experience and clarity. I started with research to understand the pain points of individuals and businesses during the pandemic, and the need for a solution that was both effective and easy to use. I focused on a clean, minimalist design with a consistent color palette to avoid confusion. Each screen was carefully crafted to guide the user through key tasks, from registration to daily check-ins. The user flow was designed to be as simple as possible, reducing friction and encouraging user adoption.</p>

    <h4></h4>
    <p> The solution is Q-Clear, a mobile application that acts as a personal health passport and a public safety tool. The core features of the app are:
      </p>
    <uL>
      <li><b>DA user-centric dashboard: </b> Allows users to easily view their health status and history.</li>
      <li><b>QR Code System:  </b> Enables quick and contactless check-ins at businesses, providing a simple way to verify an individual's status.</li>
      <li><b>Symptom Tracking: </b> A dedicated section for users to report any symptoms they may be experiencing, providing real-time health data.</li>
      <li><b>Location and History: </b> An organized log of all check-ins, giving the user a clear history of their movements and interactions.</li>
      <li><b>Public Announcements: </b> A feature to receive important health and safety updates.</li>
